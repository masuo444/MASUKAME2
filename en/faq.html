                    <h2>What makes MASUKAME hinoki wooden sculptures special?</h2>
                    <p>MASUKAME sculptures are handcrafted from premium Japanese hinoki cypress by master artisans. Each piece combines the prosperity symbol (Masu) with longevity (Kame), creating a unique luxury art piece that embodies traditional Japanese craftsmanship and cultural significance. The hinoki wood is carefully selected for its fine grain, natural fragrance, and spiritual importance in Japanese culture.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>How should I care for my hinoki wooden sculpture?</h2>
                    <p>Keep your MASUKAME sculpture away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. Avoid exposure to water or high humidity. Dust gently with a soft, dry cloth.

                    <p>While MASUKAME maintains its core design integrity, minor customizations such as finish preference (oil or urethane) can be specified during ordering.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>What is the significance of hinoki wood in Japanese culture?</h2>
                    <p>Hinoki cypress is considered sacred in Japanese culture and has been used for centuries in temple construction and ceremonial objects. Its natural antibacterial properties, fine grain, and distinctive fragrance make it highly prized. MASUKAME sculptures honor this tradition while creating contemporary art pieces that bridge cultural heritage with modern luxury collecting.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">

                    <p>MASUKAME sculptures are crafted at approximately 10cm in height and width, representing the optimal proportions for the masu and kame design elements. This size was specifically chosen to showcase the intricate details while remaining suitable for display in luxury home environments. Custom sizing is not currently available to maintain design integrity.</p>
