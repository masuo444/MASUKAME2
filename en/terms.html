                <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
                <p class="updated">Last updated: January 2025</p>

                <h2>1. Pricing and Currency</h2>
                <p>All prices are displayed and charged in United States Dollars (USD). The listed prices do not include shipping costs, customs duties, or taxes, which may apply depending on your location.</p>

                <h2>2. Payment Terms</h2>
                <p>Full payment is required upfront before production begins. We accept major credit cards and bank transfers. Payment processing fees may apply.</p>

                <h2>3. Refund Policy</h2>
                <p>Refunds are available only before production starts, with processing fees deducted from the refund amount. Once production has commenced, orders are non-refundable due to the made-to-order nature of our products.</p>

                <h2>4. Production and Lead Time</h2>
                <p>Each MASUKAME is handcrafted to order with an estimated lead time of 6â€“8 weeks. This timeframe may vary based on current production capacity and complexity of the order. We will notify you of any significant delays.</p>

                <h2>5. Shipping and Insurance</h2>
                <p>All orders include insured worldwide shipping. We are responsible for the safe delivery of your MASUKAME to the address provided. Shipping times vary by destination and are separate from production lead time.</p>

                <h2>6. Product Specifications</h2>
                <p>Each MASUKAME is hand-carved from Japanese Hinoki cypress, measuring approximately 10 cm. Natural variations in wood grain and slight differences in dimensions are inherent to handcrafted items and are not considered defects.</p>

                <h2>7. Certificate of Authenticity</h2>
                <p>Every MASUKAME includes a hand-signed paper certificate of authenticity and a unique serial number for provenance and collection tracking.</p>

                <h2>8. Care and Maintenance</h2>
                <p>To preserve your MASUKAME:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures</li>
                    <li>Avoid exposure to water or high humidity</li>
                    <li>Dust gently with a soft, dry cloth</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>Our liability is limited to the purchase price of the product. We are not responsible for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use or inability to use our products.</p>

                <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>The MASUKAME design and associated branding are protected by intellectual property rights. Reproduction or imitation without written permission is prohibited.</p>

                <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
